# Social Engineering Project

First, you need to install Renpy on your device from the official website https://www.renpy.org/latest.html. 

After having installed it, there should be a folder called 'renpy' in your directory. In this folder, you will clone this git repository.

Open your terminal and go to the renpy folder. There, you need to clone the git repository by using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/100percentcool/social-engineering-game
```

Now, you have the git repository cloned, and you can start pulling new code, committing changes, and pushing them.

In order to  start the game, you start the renpy application, and now the social engineering game should be appearing the same way the preinstalled Tutorial does.
