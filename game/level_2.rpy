    p3 "Hey Cathy, I found out about a secret meeting at the annual charity event."
    cathy2 "Great! That means we have to be there and collect some evidence for my story!"
    p3 "This will be impossible, I know that they have a guest list, we canâ€™t just show up!"

    cathy2 "I will steal some catering clothes and hide them outside for you."
